=== NOTES ===

We can use this doc folder for documentation files and general notes of any sort.
Notes that we want to preserve: temporarily or permanently

I put dummy files in each folder, because otherwise github will refuse to upload "empty" folders.

By the way,
I push onto github frequently,
just for saving the work / backing up.
(I apologize, it's a habit!)
