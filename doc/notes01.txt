=== NOTES ===

This folder is for documentation file and general notes of any sort, that we want to preserve: temporarily or permanently

===

I put dummy files in each folder, because otherwise github will refuse to upload "empty" directories.

:)

===

I push onto github frequently, just for saving the work / backing up.
(I apologize, it's a habit!)
