I'll create Linux-compatible versions of both scripts for your Debian 12 PC. The main changes I'll make include:

1. Adjusting the GPG home directory paths for Linux
2. Removing Windows-specific path handling
3. Making sure the dependencies can be installed on Linux

Let's start by creating both scripts:

I've created Linux-compatible versions of the scripts for your Debian 12 PC, along with an installation script and README file. Here's what I've provided:

1. **sendMessage.py** - The main bot script, adapted for Linux with:
   - Linux-specific GPG home directory handling
   - Proper shebang for Linux execution
   - Simplified error handling

2. **telegram_getid.py** - The utility script to get chat IDs, properly typed and formatted for Linux

3. **install_dependencies.sh** - A shell script to install all necessary dependencies:
   - Installs required system packages
   - Creates a Python virtual environment
   - Installs Python dependencies
   - Makes the scripts executable

4. **README.md** - Documentation explaining how to set up and use the bot

## How to Use These Scripts

1. First, save all the files to your Debian 12 system in the same directory structure shown in the README

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   chmod +x install_dependencies.sh
   ./install_dependencies.sh
   ```

3. Update the bot tokens:
   - In `sendMessage.py`, update `BOT_TOKEN` (if needed) and `RECIPIENT_CHAT_ID`
   - In `telegram_getid.py`, replace `'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'` with your actual bot token

4. Run the scripts:
   ```bash
   # Activate the virtual environment
   source gpg_telegram_env/bin/activate
   
   # Run the main bot
   ./sendMessage.py
   
   # Or run the utility script to get chat IDs
   ./telegram_getid.py
   ```

## Key Differences from the Windows Version

1. The GPG home directory is now set to the Linux standard `~/.gnupg`
2. Removed Windows-specific path handling
3. Added proper Linux shebangs (`#!/usr/bin/env python3`)
4. Added a dependency installation script specific to Debian
5. Improved error handling and logging for Linux environments
