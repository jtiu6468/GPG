Hey Jaine, I did some little work on the project:

- Added src2/ for source code that is the linux version of your code, so it can run on my Debian 12 Linux box

- Added some documentation: 

-- Diagrams (helpful)
-- Guide
-- Reference_Card

Now, I have to figure out, how the system really works!

:)
